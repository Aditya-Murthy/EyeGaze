# EyeGaze

The ultimate aim here is to develop programs that can convert eye-movements to speech.
This eyegaze application aims at tracking the eye movements using an integrated computer/laptop camera in native resolution.
The eye gaze is intended to be used as an augmented input method for scentence formation and other speech processing applications.

Done:
- Robust pupil tracking algorithm using haar cascade classifiers
- Implement user-defined gaze-direction calibrtaion

To do:
- Define gaze-calibration as a callable function
- Inteface to convert gaze-direction to words/commands


Current dependencies:

1. OpenCV
2. tkinter
3. numpy
