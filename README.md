# EyeGaze

The ultimate aim here is to develop programs that can convert eye-movements to speech.
This eyegaze application aims at tracking the eye movements using an integrated computer/laptop camera in native resolution.
The eye gaze is intended to be used as an augmented input method for scentence formation and other speech processing applications.

Done:
- Robust pupil tracking algorithm using haaar cascade classifiers
- User-friendly tuning of image thresholding for detection in varied lighting conditions

To do:
- Inteface to convert gaze-direction to words/commands


Current dependencies:

1. OpenCV
2. tkinter
