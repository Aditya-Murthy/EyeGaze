# EyeGaze

The ultimate aim here is to develop programs that can convert eye-movements to speech.
This eyegaze application aims at tracking the eye movements using an integrated computer/laptop camera in native resolution.
The eye gaze is intended to be used as an augmented input method for scentence formation and other speech processing applications.

Done:
- Robust pupil tracking algorithm using haaar cascade classifiers

To do-
- Implement gaze-direction calibrtaion before every run
- Inteface to convert gaze-direction to words/commands


Current dependencies:

1. OpenCV
